# Digilock
 python 3.8
 My first app...
 I do not own rights to geckodriver.exe or chromedriver.exe, these 2 programs must be updated to the same version as your browser. 
 in order to run it, you have to install python 3.8, configure env variables and all of the dependant libraries stated by the import statements in Digilock.py file, also make  sure the chrome driver is same version as browser.
