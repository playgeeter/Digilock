# Digilock
 python 3.8
 My first app...
 I do not own rights to geckodriver.exe or chromedriver.exe, these 2 programs must be updated to the same version as your browser.
 DISCLAIMER: I take absolutely 0 responsibility for any damage caused by misuse of this software. 
 it only works with chrome browser for now, I have no immediate plans for this project. however, it could be a useful app with some work. 
 
 in order to run in, you have to install python 3.8, configure env variables and all of the dependant libraries stated by the import statements in Digilock.py file, also make  sure the chrome driver is same version as browser.
